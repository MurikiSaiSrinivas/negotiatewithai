Villain: "Well, well, looks like the government finally sent someone who wants to talk. What do you have for me?"
```
### **Player Response:**
```plaintext
"I can offer you partial immunity if you return the files."
```
### **Villain Response:**
```plaintext
"Hah! Immunity from what? You think I’m scared of your justice system? Give me something real, or this conversation is over."
```
### **Final Verdict:**
```plaintext
"Fine. You drive a hard bargain, but I’ll take it. Just make sure I get out of here safely."
Verdict: WIN ✅
Feedback: "You used logic well, but next time, start with a lower offer to have room to negotiate up."
```
